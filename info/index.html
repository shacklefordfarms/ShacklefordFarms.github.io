        <h2>About the dataset</h2>
        <p align='justify'>The data presented in the map above is a subset from the United States' soil type dataset.
          According to USDA, this data is produced by the National Cooperative Soil Survey; which is operated by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS).
          This data is available for 95% of the nation's counties and can be easily downloaded throught their <a href="https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx">website</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p align='justify'>The data presented in the map corresponds to Shackleford Farms' production fields. It contains polygons that represents the area covered by a certain type of soil.
          The dataset has six different classes, five for soil types and one for superficial water. The soil types presented in this area are: Schriever-Thibaut clays, Thibaut silty clay, Cancienne silt loam, Schriever clay and Udarents.
          Moreover, the dataset presents some other information and properties for the different soil types. That information was acquired by surveying the areas, taking soil samples and submitting it to laboratorial analysis. In addition,
          it was added to the data the area of the polygons; which represents that soil type coverage area inside the Shackleford Farms.</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p class="lead">What do this map tell us about the data?</p>
        <p align='justify'>This map presents the soil type spatial variability inside the Shackleford Farms' fields. This information is very useful and important for agricultural
        practices and management. This kind of soil type information could be used in order to allocate different crops, varieties or hybrids. The decision about the type of plant
        to be planted in a certain are would be by matching the soil type with the plant that would produce the most in that area. Moreover, the soil ohter soil information, such as drainage,
        could be used in order to know what part of the field would have the most amount of water a few days after a rain. </p>
        <p align='justify'> Those are some examples of how the information presented in the map could be useful. However, the information presented could be used for many other purposes.</p>
